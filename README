This repository contains: 
        - a cyber security paper on repackaged applications
        - apks of Google Play Store's Travel Frog, Mi Store's Travel Frog, HelloWorld, and HackedToast
        - decompiled files in the RepackagingDemo folder
        - source code of HelloWorld and HackedToast in the AndroidStudioApps folder
        - a Mi advertisement SDK demo I found in the MiAdDemo folder
        - recordings of original and repackaged applications 


Note:
        - the recording of Mi Store's Travel Frog shows a grey screen instead of advertisement because during my exploration I upgraded to a new MIUI version and the AdServer.apk in Travel Frog couldn't get installled.
